# Abstract

Human displacement is often linked to climate change not without reason: the increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts are expected to impact the livelihoods of millions. However, lacking knowledge about human mobility in drought contexts restricts effective modelling and forecasting. Drought displacement is multicausal and contextual, and its key drivers, associated timescales, and causal-effect lags are uncertain and often assessed using mechanistic models and qualitative assumptions. Here, we propose a quantitative data-driven approach to model and discover the causes of drought-induced displacement in Somalia over the period 2010-2022. Our approach recognizes the context-specific causality of different districts and highlights specific vulnerabilities associated with water and food security systems and violent conflict episodes. Our results pave the way towards algorithms capable of discovering knowledge from human mobility data for anticipation, policy-making, and humanitarian aid.

Pipeline overview to understand internal displacement through causal discovery. Total number and percentage of new displacements attributed to droughts and conflicts in Somalia during the years 2010-2022 (a). The three selected Somalia districts included in the study (Baidoa, Diinsoor, Qoryooley) are analyzed between $2010-2022$ with environmental (precipitation), socioeconomic (food, livestock, and water prices), and conflict drivers (fatalities) (b). Preprocessing of the time series and the application of conditional independence tests, we derive causal graphs per district with the PCMCI method (c).
